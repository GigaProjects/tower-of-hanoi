# Tower of Hanoi

A python command-line implementation of the classic Tower of Hanoi game.

## How to Run

Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
python hanoi.py
```

(If that doesn't work, try `python3 hanoi.py`)

## How to Play

1. Select number of rings (1-10)
2. Move all rings from Tower **A** to Tower **D**
3. Use two-letter commands to move rings:
   - `AS` - move from A to S
   - `AD` - move from A to D
   - `SD` - move from S to D
   - etc.

**Special commands:**
- `Q` - Quit
- `R` - Restart

## Rules

- Only one ring can be moved at a time
- A ring can only be placed on top of a larger ring
- You can use Tower S as an auxiliary tower


Good luck!
